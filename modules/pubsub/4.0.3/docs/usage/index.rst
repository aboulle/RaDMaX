If you are new to PyPubSub, you will likely want to start with :ref:`label-usage-basic`.
If you want a quick start, jump the :ref:`label-quick-start` section. 

If you develop an application that uses PyPubSub, whether it is prototype or production
quality code, if it is more than just an experiment you will find that it can become
tedious to debug. This is because the decouping can make the link between 
causes and effects challenging to identify. Also, you need better control over error 
handling, and more maintainability via documentation of message structure. This is when 
you turn to the :ref:`label-usage-advanced` section.
