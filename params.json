{"name":"RaDMaX","tagline":"A graphical user inferface for the determination of strain and damage profiles in irradiated crystals from X-ray diffraction data.","body":"# Installation instructions\r\nDownload zip file and extract it to your disk.\r\n\r\nRadmax requires [python 2.7] (http://www.python.org), [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org), [Matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org) and [wxpython] (http://www.wxpython.org).\r\nFor the moment, the wxpython library is not compatible with Python 3 and above. **RaDMaX won't work with Python 3.**\r\n\r\n\r\n## MS Windows\r\n1. For most users, especially on Windows and Mac, the easiest way to install scientific Python is to download **one** of these Python distributions, which includes most of the key packages:\r\n \r\n * [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads): A free distribution for the SciPy stack. Supports Linux, Windows and Mac. [Download.](https://3230d63b5fc54e62148e-c95ac804525aac4b6dba79b00b39d1d3.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Anaconda-2.3.0-Windows-x86.exe)\r\n * [Python(x,y)](http://python-xy.github.io/): A free distribution including the SciPy stack, based around the Spyder IDE. Windows only. [Download.](http://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/devel/pythonxy/Python(x,y)-2.7.10.0.exe)\r\n * [WinPython](http://winpython.github.io/): A free distribution including the SciPy stack. Windows only. [Download.] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_2.7/2.7.9.5/WinPython-32bit-2.7.9.5.exe/download)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Download and install [WxPython] (http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython3.0-win32-3.0.2.0-py27.exe)\r\n3. In a shell, run the Radmax.py file with `python Radmax.py`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## GNU / Linux\r\n1. On most Linux systems the dependencies are available in the software repositories. For debian based systems run (as root): `apt-get install python python-scipy python-matplolib python-wxgtk3.0`. \r\n2. In a terminal, run the Radmax.py file with `python Radmax.py`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Quick test of the program\r\n1. In a text editor open the *.ini file located in the \"examples/YSZ\" or \"examples/SiC-3C\" folder. Modify lines 5-7: insert the paths of the files on your system. For instance, for a Radmax file located in the \"documents\" folder:\r\n\r\n   * Windows: C:\\Users\\User_name\\Documents\\\r\n   * Linux: /home/user_name/Documents/\r\n2. Launch Radmax.py.\r\n3. In the \"File\" menu select \"Load Project\".\r\n4. Navigate to the \"examples/YSZ\" or \"examples/SiC-3C\" folder and load the *.ini file.\r\n\r\n* Any change in any of the upper panels has to be validated with the \"Update\" button to update the XRD curve.\r\n* The strain and damage profiles can be modified by dragging the control points. The XRD curve is updated in real time.\r\n* The strain and damage profile can be scaled up or down with the mouse wheel + pressing the \"u\" key. The XRD curve is update when the \"u\" key is released.\r\n* Calculated XRD curves can be fitted to experimental data in the \"Fitting window\" tab.\r\n* Conventional least-squares (recommended) or generalized simulated annealing algorithm can be used.\r\n* The fitted curve, the strain and damage profiles are automatically saved (*.txt) in the folder selected above. \r\n\r\n# Data format\r\nXRD data can be loaded from the \"File\" menu. The data should be provided as a two-columns (2thêta, intensity) ASCII file in space- (or tab-) separated format. The 2thêta values have to be equally spaced (constant step). For the moment RaDMaX can only handle data recorded in symmetric coplanar geometry (conventional thêta-2thêta scan), as this is the most commonly used geometry in the analysis of irradiated materials.\r\n\r\nGuess strain/damage profile can be imported from the \"File\" menu. The data should be providedas a two-columns ASCII file with the depth below the surface (in Angstroms) as first column.\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\nRaDMaX running in Windows 10.\r\n\r\n# Screencast\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
